The theme of Ludum Dare 28 is "you only get one". In my game, I will explore the theme in terms of what it says about sharing. This game will be a zelda-like, and the working title is "Heart" for reasons that you will probably be able to guess.

 - Twitter: I've forked [sign-in-with-twitter][1] to use as a base, since my game will require that you... sign in with twitter.
 - Quintus: this [magnificent HTML5 game framework][2] will provide me with the necessary hearts.
 - Tower Man: the tutorial I'll be using to get myself off the ground. [Tower Man][3] is not a zelda-like, but its close enough. ^o^//
